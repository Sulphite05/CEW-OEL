cJSON is an ultra-lightweight JSON parser in C:

    1. Single file: Both the core functionality and header file are contained in a single file, making it easy to integrate into your projects.
    2. Simple API: It focuses on a streamlined and intuitive API for working with JSON data.
    3. No external dependencies: cJSON doesn't rely on any additional libraries, minimizing setup complexity.
    4. Focus on parsing and manipulation: It primarily focuses on parsing JSON data and building complex JSON structures within your C programs.
    5. Compact and efficient: cJSON boasts a small footprint and minimal resource usage, ideal for embedded systems and performance-critical applications.

Common use cases for cJSON:

    2. Building and sending JSON requests to APIs.
    3. Storing and manipulating JSON data within your C programs.
    4. Exchanging data between C programs and other applications (web se
